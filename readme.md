About this Project
------------------

This project contains scripts to process the files and metadata for the Big Australian Speech Corpus (BigASC).  
The original data is collected using the BlackBox application and then uploaded to a central server 
via a custom Django application (bigasc).  These scipts convert the various forms of metadata to RDF and
process the audio and video files into a form ready for publication.  The final published version of
the data is served via another Django application (smallasc).
