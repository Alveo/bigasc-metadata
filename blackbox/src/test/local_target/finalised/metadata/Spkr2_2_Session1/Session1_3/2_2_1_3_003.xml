They lived in a very dark and dreary old place. The roof let the rain come washing in, making shallow pools on the muddy floor. The beams and rafters were all rotten through, so eventually the whole structure was quite unsafe. At last, one of the joists gave way and the beams fell down. The walls shook and the ceiling collapsed with a loud bang. The rats shrieked and their fur stood on end with fear and horror. "This won't do," said their leader with a scowl. "We can't stay cooped up here any longer." So he sent out scouts to search for a new home.</prompt><timestamp>Wed Jul  6 12:36:06 2011</timestamp><colour>2</colour><participant>Green-Arnhem Sheath-tailed Bat</participant><component>3</component><item>3</item><session>1</session><animal>2</animal><basename>2_2_1_3_003</basename><files><file md5hash="098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6" uploaded="false">finalised/video/Spkr2_2_Session1/Session1_3/2_2_1_3_003camera-1-left.mp4</file><file md5hash="098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6" uploaded="false">finalised/video/Spkr2_2_Session1/Session1_3/2_2_1_3_003camera-1-right.mp4</file><file md5hash="f2a15f6dd26a910f876504da1f4c962e" uploaded="false">finalised/audio/Spkr2_2_Session1/Session1_3/2_2_1_3_003left.wav</file><file md5hash="432560d7cd34c4c116c45fbfaa835f10" uploaded="false">finalised/audio/Spkr2_2_Session1/Session1_3/2_2_1_3_003right.wav</file></files><path>test/local_target</path></item>
