Notes on metadata format for Austalk

Metadata is ingested from the following sources into a single triple store:

- blackbox protocol (sessions, components, prompts, etc)
- website database (participants)
- item xml metadata (items, files)

pending ingestion:

- QA spreadsheets (component ratings)
- RA spreadsheets (map task speakers, DOBs)

We use a number of namespaces:

Most classes and properties for austalk metadata use the austalk prefix:
PREFIX austalk: <http://ns.austalk.edu.au/>

Entities in the protocol (components, items etc) use this prefix:
PREFIX protocol: <http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/>

This is the location of data files:
PREFIX austalkd: <http://data.austalk.edu.au/>

We use AusNC namespace for items and some corpus level metadata
to build in some compatibility where possible:
PREFIX ausnc: <http://ns.ausnc.org.au/schemas/ausnc_md_model/>

FOAF is used for people:
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

OLAC for some metadata properties:
PREFIX olac: <http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.1/>

The GRAF namespace is used in annotation:
PREFIX graf: <http://www.xces.org/ns/GrAF/1.0/>

Various general namespaces:

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>


We use the following (OWL) classes:

These classes are used to define the protocol, so for example there are
four instances of Session which define our four sessions.

austalk:Session - a session
austalk:Component - a component
austalk:Item - an item

foaf:Person - a participant
austalk:RecordingSite - a recording site
austalk:MediaFile - a wav or mp4 file
ausnc:AusNCObject - an item (single prompted recording)

Here are some examples that show how things are linked together. 

A participant record links to the recording site, includes a birth year (full date
of birth is not copied over to protect privacy) and a reference to birthPlace as 
a Geonames URI which will resolve to an RDF description of that place (this has
been automatically generated via the geonames search service).

Most properties are simple literal values but some are multi-valued with anonymous 
nodes as values, eg. education_history below.  In the RDF graph, this value 
is a node with properties (age_from, etc).  

    <http://id.austalk.edu.au/participant/2_450> a foaf:Person;
        dbpedia:birthYear 1957;
        austalk:birthPlace <http://sws.geonames.org/2146268>;
        austalk:recording_site <http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/site/CSUB>;
        foaf:gender "female" .
        austalk:cultural_heritage "Australian";
        austalk:education_history [ austalk:age_from 40;
                austalk:age_to 45;
                austalk:name "Charles Sturt University";
                austalk:participant_id 2 ],
            [ austalk:age_from 8;
                austalk:age_to 12;
                austalk:name "Palmwoods Primary School";


A recording site has an rdfs:label which is the short name that will be used in
URIs for data.  

    <http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/site/CSUB> a austalk:RecordingSite;
        rdfs:label "CSUB";
        austalk:city "Bathurst";
        austalk:institution "Charles Sturt University" .


Sessions and components have names in the protocol namespace 
(http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/).  Components are linked to the session via
the dc:isPartOf relation, however in a couple of cases there will be no
link to a session - these are old components that aren't currently used 
in recordings -- we may need to add relations manually depending on how we 
make use of this info.

<http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/session/4> a austalk:Session;
    austalk:id 4;
    austalk:name "Session 3.2" .

The shortname property of components will be used in URIs for data files:

<http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/component/1> a austalk:Component;
    austalk:id 1;
    austalk:name "Yes/No Opening";
    austalk:shortname "yes-no-opening-1";
    dc:isPartOf <http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/session/1> .

Items 

<http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/item/11_10> a austalk:Item;
    austalk:id 10;
    austalk:prompt "Turn left 15  (face +45)  11";
    dc:isPartOf <http://id.austalk.edu.au/protocol/component/11> .



The actual data is represented as instances of AusNCObject and includes all of 
the metadata from the XML file associated with the item.  It includes links to the 
component and item in the protocol and to the participant.  The media property
links to the individual media files.

    <http://ns.austalk.edu.au/1_178_2_16_001> a ausnc:AusNCObject;
        austalk:basename "1_178_2_16_001";

Media files are identified by a URI that links to the actual file, the properties
describe the file including the type (audio or video) and channel name.  The version
property is used to differentiate between sets of recordings for an item - the -n files.
Usually there will be just a version 1 but if there was a second recording (resulting
in -n files) then there will also be a version 2 and so on for version 3 etc. 

    <http://data.austalk.edu.au/ANUC/2/sentences/1_178_2_16_001-ch1-maptask.wav> a austalk:MediaFile;
        austalk:channel "ch1-maptask";
        austalk:checksum "f4708488df8438edb1f301dfbc43b683";
        austalk:type "audio";
        austalk:version 1 .
        
We also need a property on each AusNCObject to say which version of the recordings
is the correct one.  At the moment we have no interface for entering this data.
